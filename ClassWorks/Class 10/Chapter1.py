# 1.1 Unpacking a Sequence into Separate Variables

# Problem: You have an N-element tuple or sequence that you would like to unpack into a collection of N variables

a = (4, 5)  # -> Any sequence (or iterable) can be unpacked into variables using simple assignment operation
x, y = a  # The only requirement is that the number of variables and structure match the sequence

print(x)  # Printing the value of x according to the structure
print(y)  # Printing the value of y according to the structure
